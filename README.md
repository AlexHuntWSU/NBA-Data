# NBA-Data

Big Question: With this project, I wanted to find out if a home court advantage in basketball actually exists and if so, what stats such as FT and 3P percentages are most effected. In my analysis, I also looked over offensive and defensive ratings to find out which is better for winning.

Data Process: My data for this project comes from the NBA website and was collect by manual data entry into Excel as there was no option to save the data as a csv file. The [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/) database is very comprehensive but I only needed the win percentage (win%), free throw percentage (FT%), field goal percentage (FG%), 3 point percentage (3P%), and offensive and defensive ratings for both home and away games. With only 30 teams and one season, manual input was manageable. However, if I wanted to extend my analysis over multiple seasons and additional statistics, I would need to incorporate data mining or find another data source.
